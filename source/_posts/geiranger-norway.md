When To Go
April-May & September-October
If you’re dreaming of a white Christmas, Norway is your place. Geiranger receives a lot of snow in the winter, which transforms the landscape into an icy wonderland. But this weather is not always ideal for travel, and many of the best hikes and views will be closed off. Summer is beautiful but can be incredibly crowded as cruise ships find their way to the fjord. We recommend late spring and early autumn to catch the weather turning and fewer tourists.

Dashing Through The Fjord
Yes, the preferred method of travel during the holiday season is a sleigh, but trust us, a kayak is a good alternative. Get up close and personal with the natural beauty by gliding across the icy glacier water to tour the fjord. Pass through the mist of the Seven Sisters and Lonely Suitor waterfalls, and discover the fables and myths of this magical region.

Did Someone Say Road Trip?
Hold onto your lunch, Trollstigen road is not for the faint of heart. This serpentine road winds up the mountain through hairpin turns and impossibly steep climbs. This nail-biting “Troll Path” redeems its precarious journey, however, with incredible vistas.

Cameras out!
If you want to access the best viewpoint in Geiranger, be prepared for a bit of a hike. Flydalsjuvet is an incredible photo opp, but it will take you off trail a ways through some slippery terrain. The view at the end is definitely worth it.
