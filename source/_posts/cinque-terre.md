With a whole wide world of fantastic places to choose from, we had a tough time picking just one destination to kick off 2018. So we cheated a little and picked 5. Cinque Terre is a web of picturesque Italian towns and groppos that stretch along the scenic Italian Riviera coastline. Implied in the name (“cinque” meaning five and “terre” meaning lands) there are five large villages in the area. Each town warrants its own feature, but it would be criminal to separate them. Collectively they make up one of the most idyllic destinations in all of Italy.

April-September

Book your flight during the prime months of April through September to experience everything Cinque Terre has to offer. The summer months will be met with more tourists, but the weather is perfect for hiking and swimming in the sea. You might want to check out some festivals too, especially the ones that revolve around food: Lemons in May and Anchovies in September. Also, each town honors its own patron saint, with celebrations throughout the summer.
